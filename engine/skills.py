"""Imported Skills — the revenue seam.

A Skill is just a Markdown file. The app reads two shelves: built-in skills bundled
in the UI, and *imported* skills living in ``~/.filingsmcp/skills/``. Premium packs
(sold later as a paid .md download) arrive through the very same import path — drop the
file in this folder and it shows up like any other skill. Because the folder lives in
the user's home, not the app bundle, imported skills survive reinstalls and updates with
no licence server, no DRM, no phone-home. Ownership = possession of the file.

Optional YAML-ish frontmatter (``name`` / ``tier`` / ``desc``) drives how the skill is
labelled; with no frontmatter we derive a sensible name from the filename and default to
the Free tier, so a plain community .md imports cleanly.
